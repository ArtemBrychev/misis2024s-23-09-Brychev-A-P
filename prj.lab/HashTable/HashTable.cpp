/* BFG 9000: The BFG is obviously Doom's most infamous weapon. It is the most 
powerful weapon in the game. It uses energy cells, the same ammo that the 
Plasma Gun uses. Each shot uses up 40 cells, so you cannot use this weapon if 
you have less than that. One thing you need to be aware of is that there is a 
slight delay when firing the BFG, as it takes a second to charge. You can use 
this to your advantage, however. For example, you can fire the BFG and open a 
door while the BFG is charging up, that way you can catch your enemies by 
surprise. It is a great weapon for taking out groups of enemies, weak or 
strong. It can take out a Cyberdemon or a Spider Mastermind with 3 or 4 hits. 
When the big green energy ball hits something, it can cause splash damage to 
other enemies in sight. First found in Level 11: Refinery in the Ultimate Doom 
levels and Level 38: Tricks and Traps in the Doom II levels. */
